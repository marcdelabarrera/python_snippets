      "    For floating point numbers the numerical precision of sum (and\n",
      "    ``np.add.reduce``) is in general limited by directly adding each number\n",
      "    individually to the result causing rounding errors in every step.\n",
      "    However, often numpy will use a  numerically better approach (partial\n",
      "    pairwise summation) leading to improved precision in many use-cases.\n",
      "    This improved precision is always provided when no ``axis`` is given.\n",
      "    When ``axis`` is given, it will depend on which axis is summed.\n",
      "    Technically, to provide the best speed possible, the improved precision\n",

      "    Note that the exact precision may vary depending on other parameters.\n",
      "    In contrast to NumPy, Python's ``math.fsum`` function uses a slower but\n",

      "    numbers, such as ``float32``, numerical errors can become significant.\n",
